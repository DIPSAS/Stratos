Stratos
===
When using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and tools like [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/), deploying software to tens or hundreds of servers goes like a breeze. But it is also easy to get confused: "What is actually running on the server right now?"

Stratos is a dead simple HTTP API that provides this information for you - making it great for information gathering on the entire testing cluster or just a simple check on that one team server.

> Stratos is a chocolate made by Nidar in Trondheim, Norway. Please don't sue me for the name of this project, I love that chocolate.
